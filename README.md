## Introduction
> <b>In this project, I would be analyzing a data set from a virtual online retail store to obtain effective insights that would equip the business’s CEO and CMO to make an empowering and informed business decision.<b/>
>
>### Objective
> <b>The main objective of this analysis is to obtain effective insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the buisness. Thus, at the end of this analysis, I should provide visually and non-visually supported answers to the questions provided at this page's **'Questions of Interest’** section..
>
> These set of questions which are considered to be likely questions of interest to be asked by the CEO and CMO of an online retail store in a typical business scenario where the business has been provided sales data sets with information that are relevant to the CEO and CMO respectively.<b/>

## The Business Background
> <b>The online retail store business is interested in the review of their data, such that valuable insights could be drawn and provided to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyze what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for the next year.
> 
> The management is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what is working and review what is not working. They would also view metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.<b/>

## The Buisness Scenario
> <b>From a close review of the data set, taking note of the information that has been provided and the insights that can be garnered of what is relevant to both the CEO and the CMO respectively. Below is a set of questions that the CEO and CMO would likely want answers to.<b/>
> 
> ### <b>Questions of interest to the CEO
>* #### Show the revenue trend of the business for the year 2011 only.
>* #### What is the demand for the business products across the regions where the business is operational?
>The CEO is interested in knowing which countries have the greatest demands for the business products, as having the idea of countries with seemingly high demands would enable the CEO to initiate an expansion strategy that would enable the business to target these areas and generate more business from them. There would be no need to show the demand data for the United Kingdom in this analysis, as the CEO is more interested in viewing the demand of other countries with expansion opportunities.<b/>
> 
> ### Questions of interest to the CMO
>* #### Excluding the United kingdom from the analysis, what are the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue?
>The CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated for the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue, excluding The United Kingdom.
>* #### Who are the top revenue generating customers?
> The CMO is interested in the visuals that shows the top revenue-generating customers. The CMO wants to target higher revenue-generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.

### Methodology and Project Workflow
To achieve the objectives of this project, I did the following:
> - I obtained the data set from [Tata Data Visualization Virtual Experience Programme](https://cdn.theforage.com/vinternships/companyassets/ifobHAoMjQs9s6bKS/5XsFFJu2oCLdmYJW2/1654128941410/Online%20Retail.xlsx).
> - Cleaned the data using Python on Jupyter Notebook, and carried out [CEO]( https://github.com/arovo-ds/EDA-Online-Retail-Store-/blob/main/notebooks/Exploratory%20Analysis%20and%20Visualizations%20for%20the%20CEO.ipynb) and [CMO]( https://github.com/arovo-ds/EDA-Online-Retail-Store-/blob/main/notebooks/Exploratory%20Analysis%20and%20Visualizations%20for%20the%20CMO.ipynb) based exploration on the already [cleaned data]( https://github.com/arovo-ds/EDA-Online-Retail-Store-/blob/main/notebooks/Data%20Cleaning.ipynb).
> - I carried out data visualization on the cleaned dataset using Power Bi Desktop and then created a report for my visualization PowerPoint report, which could be viewed [here].
